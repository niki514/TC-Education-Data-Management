Children planned, performed, and interpreted experiments to learn about the relations between design features and speed of race cars in a computerized microworld. The group made progress, but by the end of the sessions did not fully understand those features that disconfirmed their initial beliefs. In their activity with the microworld. children often failed to make informative comparisons or valid judgments about the outcomes. Exploratory strategies improved as children exercised them over time, but invalid heuristics that preserved children’s favored theories about cars were evident throughout.  Those children using more valid strategies achieved more complete, stable comprehension of the microworld’s structure. In turn, children used their beliefs to make meaning of the complex patterns of evidence they observed. The most successful children evaluated both the evidence and their changing theories, and were sensitive to the fact that they should be mutually constraining.","1990","2020-06-12 05:02:56","2020-06-12 05:08:14","","31-57","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Argument: In this study, Schauble examines the process through which children generate and interpret evidence, and the role of prior belief in developing conclusions.  A group of 5th and 6th graders were given a task in which they had to determine the fastest car, given a set of 5 variables that could affect (or not affect) the speed of the car.  In some cases, the relationship between the variable and speed confirmed students beliefs, and in other cases, beliefs were disconfirmed.  Students' strategies were coded into 4 components: planning, comparison, judgement, and justification.</p> <p>In the planning phase, children often did not use systematic strategies, although most were able to make high level plans, which were systematic and involved comparison of features.  In the comparison phase, children often used information from both current and prior experiments, and their experiments were often not designed to allow them to make comparisons across one feature.  In the judgement phase, valid comparisons and invalid comparisons tended to lead to valid judgements and invalid judgements, respectively.  Lastly, in the justification phase, evidence based judgements often were tied to observed correlations, and invalid judgements had justifications related to experiments. </p> <p>Altogether, it was evident that the integration of knowledge with evidence was often unconscious, children tended to stick to weak strategies until they saw how those actively worked against them, and children often tried to make evidence fit with invalid theories, even when the evidence contradicted said theories.</p> <p>Context: Schauble addresses a growing body of research that suggests that reasoning depends on domain specific knowledge, as opposed to just cognitive ability.  They use this study to examine the relationship between prior knowledge and reasoning abilities. </p> <p>My Intervention: This study provides insight into the degree to which elementary schoolers are able to abstract information from observation.  While they are capable of doing so, they are not cognitive of this.  As a result, they are not able to use the most effective strategies.  This shows that observing the process rather than just the outcome of problem solving leads to a better understanding of students' abilities and gaps in understanding.  It also suggests that metacognitive tasks are the main gap that differentiates elementary schoolers from adults in their problem-solving process.</p>","C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Belief Revision in Children.pdf; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Belief Revision in Children pg 2.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Belief Revision in Children pg 1.jpg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within this approach, abstract ideas and the planning of investigations and analysis of their results are in large part postponed until higher grades. This practice stems from purported developmental constraints on children's thinking. This article analyzes these constraints in light of the writings of Piaget, to whom they are frequently attributed, and contemporary developmental theory and research. Neither the Piagetian nor the non-Piagetian research supports the validity of these developmental assumptions. The article also identifies several intrinsic problematic aspects of this approach to children's science, including the failure to appreciate the challenge of adequate scientific description, the liabilities of decontextualization, and the epistemological messages it conveys to children. Both Piagetian and non-Piagetian literatures support the feasibility  of children's science curricula in which the processes previously approached as ends become tools in contextualized and authentic scientific inquiry.","1995","2020-06-10 04:50:45","2020-06-10 04:53:20","","93-127","","2","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Argument: Metz argues that differentiation between concrete and formal operational thinkers in science education is both misinformed and limiting.  Firstly, the idea that formal operational thinkers are incapable of abstract thought is false.  It may appear that they are because they lack domain-specific knowledge that adults tend to have and they struggle with reflective, metacognitive thought.  However, they are able to abstract theories from observation, as studies in Paigetian and post-Piagetian psychology show.  Secondly, even though concrete operational thinkers are able to use serialization and classification, Metz argues that these are tools they use to develop theories, and are not used isolation.  Finally, students' abstract thinking appears most clearly in goal-oriented tasks, which is something they often do not experience in science classrooms, as lessons are decontextualized from the observable world and from adult scientific communities.</p> <p>Context: Metz is critical of the structure of American science curricula in the 1990s, which misconstrue conclusions drawn from studies in developmental psychology, and use these conclusions as a way of decontextualizing and limiting children's access to rigorous and interesting scientific study in elementary school.</p> <p>My Intervention: Children think in a goal-oriented manner, and greatly benefit from communities of learners in developing and testing theories.  As such, effective curricula need to be tied to the world in order to best engage students and ensure that the information they take from school is easily transferrable across contexts.  These ideas are supported by literature in developmental psychology, which suggests that children learn and think through observation and roughly scientific thought patterns.  One of the main reasons adults fail to see this is children lack metacognitive abilities, and are often unable to explain the reasoning behind their processes.</p>","C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Reassessment of Developmental Constraints Pg 2.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Reassessment of Developmental Constraints Pg 1.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Reassessment of Developmental Constraints Pg 3.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Reassessment of Developmental Constraints on Children's Science Instruction.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A paradox in Vygotsky's theory is highlighted, where evidence is found both for claiming that Vygotsky was a behaviorist and that he was a constructivist. Similarities in the two theories are presented: social factors as having a central role in child development, the transformative nature of internalization, and the individual as what develops. Differences in the theories pertain to the nature of the stimulus, nature and origin of psychological instruments, nature of self-regulation and novelty in development, direction of development, the concept of social development, and the role of language in development. Because practical applications of theories often clarify the theories, some educational extensions of Vygotsky's theory are critiqued from a Piagetian constructivist perspective, and, in contrast, constructivist educational interpretations of Vygotsky's work are noted. Aspects of Piaget's theory emphasized by educators are presented, and educational practices inspired by this theory are outlined. A rapprochement is sought, with consideration of convergences in educational practices of followers of Piaget and Vygotsky, sources of difficulty for rapprochement, and changes necessary in educational theories of followers of both Piaget and Vygotsky.","2000","2020-07-25 17:45:11","2020-10-13 18:28:30","","187-213","","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Argument:  This text outlines Vygotsky's and Piaget's theories with respect to behaviourism and constructivism.  The theorists' ideas have several similiarities: they both believe social factors play a role in child development and that internalization is not a process of copying material.  However, they vary in their ideas regarding the nature of stimulus,self-regulation, etc.  Educational implementations of each theory are described, particularly with respect to Vygotsky's zone of proximal development and Piaget's definitions of heteronomous vs autonomous morality.  Ultimately, Piaget's theories are more salient in American education, in part because Vygotsky's have been (mis)interpreted as similar to the banking method of education.</p> <p>Context: This text is meant to integrate the discourses of Piagetian and Vygotskyian developmental psychology.</p> <p>My Intervention: It seems as though analyzing MSFJ and FOK with respect to Vygotsky's theories may not be useful, given the perception in education that his ideas were similar to the banking model of education.  However, his idea that knowledge is socially constructed (which is shared by Piaget) is particularly interesting for both approaches to mathematics education, because it is the foundation for both.</p>","C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Vygotsky_Piaget_and education pg 5.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Vygotsky_Piaget_and education pg 4.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Vygotsky_Piaget_and education pg 3.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Vygotsky_Piaget_and education pg 2.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Vygotsky_Piaget_and education pg 1.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\Vygotsky_ Piaget_ and education_ a reciprocal assimilation of theories and educational practices.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first two such writers they address, Frantz Fanon and Paulo Freire, draw on a humanist ethics of social freedom, whereas the latter two, Amartya Sen and Jack Mezirow, turn respectively to Immanuel Kant’s moral theory of individual freedom and Jürgen Habermas’s ethics of communicative interaction. Hearfield and Boughton begin by discussing various shortcomings of the approach each of these writers takes, and then argue that a more adequate grounding can be found in Axel Honneth’s ethics of recognition, where the idea of social freedom again comes to prominence.

To counter the often inaccurate assumptions, Piaget's social theory is summarized, including an account of his consideration of the relations between the individual and the social in sociomoral, affective, and intellectual development. His emphasis on the role of norms in development is discussed. Piaget's view of the identity of cognitive operations and social co-operations is explained with examples.

Therefore, it is not known whether knowledge about successful strategies displayed on static tasks can be transferred to interactive and dynamic environments. This study investigated whether students’ knowledge of a certain strategy (i.e., vary-one-thing-at-a-time, VOTAT) that was assessed in a paper-and-pencilbased scientific reasoning task as well as their fluid intelligence and learning orientation would be sufficient to explain variance in the application of the VOTAT strategy in solving an interactive complex problem solving (CPS) task (i.e., CPS strategy). Furthermore, we analyzed whether CPS strategy mediated the relation between the predictors (i.e., scientific reasoning, learning orientation, fluid intelligence) and CPS performance. The sample consisted of N = 3,191 Finnish students attending the 6th and 9th grades. Results revealed that all predictors were significantly related to CPS strategy, but a substantial amount of variance in CPS strategy remained unexplained (DR2 = .583). Furthermore, CPS strategy mediated the relation between the predictors and CPS performance. Three implications are discussed: Different demands on the problem solver, knowledge transfer from static versus interactive tasks, or metastrategic knowledge may explain the unexplained variance in CPS strategy. Additionally, the results of our mediation analyses emphasize the importance of measuring strategies via logfiles to gain a deeper understanding of determinants of students’ CPS performance. Finally, fostering motivational factors such as students’ learning orientation yields small improvements in CPS performance.","2014","2020-06-23 05:10:11","2020-06-23 05:12:41","","127-146","","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Argument: Through an analysis of students' applications of varying one thing at a time to a static and dynamic task, the researchers determine that fluid intelligence, scientific reasoning and learning orientation influence performance on a complex problem solving task.  Additionally, knowledge of the complex problem solving strategy (varying one variable at a time) mediated the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable.  Finally, some variance between performance on the static and dynamic task was unaccounted for, and could be explained by a lack of metastrategic knowledge, which would result in the strategy not being transferred between different types of tasks.</p> <p>Context: This study comes from an understanding that tasks in school are overwhelmingly static, and a desire to understand the degree to which students can transfer their strategic knowledge to more dynamic situations.</p> <p>My Intervention: This article provides a great degree of clarity to my understanding of the factors involved in students' abilities to solve complex problems independently.  However, it is still unclear as to how these factors develop, especially in relation to Piagetian stages.</p>","C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\The Role of Strategy Knowledge for the Application of Strategies Pg 2.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\The Role of Strategy Knowledge for the Application of Strategies Pg 1.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\The Role of Strategy Knowledge for the Application of Strategies in Complex Problem Solving Tasks.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were 14 junior high school and high school science teachers who attended a professional development course. Data collection was carried out by triangulation of several data sources: classroom observations, individual interviews, written assignments, and recordings of discussions that took place during the course. The Findings section provides a detailed analysis of the professional development of 2 teachers, as well as an analysis of the development of the 14 teachers as a group. The data provide evidence for the types of knowledge teachers need for applying MSK in the course of instruction, the most specific of which are MSK of thinking skills (that must be explicit) and pedagogical knowledge regarding MSK. The considerable overall development in teachers' MSK following an in-service course consisted of at least 3 different patterns of development: (a) learning MSK regarding new thinking skills, (b) transforming initially implicit metalevel knowledge into explicit metalevel knowledge, and (c) introducing changes in the class culture to value new forms of discourse regarding thinking. The implications for professional development courses in this field are discussed.","2006","2020-06-21 03:45:08","2020-06-21 03:50:59","","331-377","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Argument: In this study, the researcher studies the development of teachers' use of metastrategic thinking in the classroom after a professional development course on the subject.  While many teachers started the course with little explicit knowledge of metastrategic knowledge, several of them were able to implement components of this order of thought toward the end of the course.  This occurred as they developed vocabulary around higher order thought and developed the classroom culture to value this form.  Additionally, implementation required a combination of strategic (content), pedagogical, and pedagogical content knowledge.</p> <p>Context: This study comes out of an understanding that teachers tend to have low levels of metastrategic knowledge, and a desire to understand how this can be changed through professional development.</p> <p>My Intervention: To what extent are the concrete operational and formal operational stages shaped by levels of metacognitive understanding?  To what extent is metacognitive understanding shaped by development, and to what extent is it shaped by teaching?</p>","C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\The Nature and Development of Teachers Metastrategic Knowledge pg 2.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\The Nature and Development of Teachers Metastrategic Knowledge pg 1.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\The Nature and Development of Teachers' Metastrategic Knowledge in the Context of Teaching Higher Order Thinking.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we describe a method designed to permit the study of developmental process and present an initial and a replication study that illustrate the kinds of data and insights this method yields.","1982","2020-06-19 03:48:46","2020-06-19 03:54:09","","1-42","","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Argument: In this study, the researchers examine the hypothesis, experimentation, and inference strategies of children in 4th and 5th grade as they repeatedly encounter a given problem.  They determined that students' anticipatory schemes lead them to be more likely to draw valid conclusions, even when they use inefficient experimentation and inference strategies.  Additionally, cognitive development and learning are tied together and are very similar processes.</p> <p>They also observed that even when children begin to use new, more efficient strategies, they do not abandon the old ones.  In order to do so, they need to effectively use metastrategic tools.  These allow them to understand the significance of their strategy, and understand when it is best applied.  While metastrategic tools are common among children, they require more complex thought processes than simply using a pre-determined strategy.</p> <p>Context: This study addresses a gap in the discipline of development psychology.  Although there is a depth of literature measuring knowledge attained at certain stages, there is little information on how children learn to solve problems.</p> <p>My Intervention: This analysis of the process of learning seems to more productively relate to K-12 education than Piagetian psychology, given that it addresses the patterns of thought required to learn a concept in a generalizable way.  Generalizability, or the ability to apply a concept to multiple different tasks, is one of the goals of MFSJ and funds of knowledge approaches to math education.</p>","C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\The Development of Problem-Solving Strategies pg 3.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\The Development of Problem-Solving Strategies pg 1.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\The Development of Problem-Solving Strategies pg 2.jpg; C:\Users\Niki\Desktop\Zotero Files\The Development of Problem Solving Strategies.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
